predictiveCapability
====================

To use the program, run the main file.
You will be prompted with a prompt asking what you believe
the return will be for the S&P 500 index the following day.

Enter a percent as a percentage point.
For example, 2.4% would mean the user types in 2.4
For -.7% the user would input -0.7

Then a menu will be presented asking the user to type the ticker
symbol for the stock they would like to predict. The user must type
in only the ticker symbol as written in all capital form. If this is
not done a error message will appear asking the user to try again.
After one prediction, the user can then predict a different stock
if they choose.

Once done, the user can type 'quit' to exit the program.
